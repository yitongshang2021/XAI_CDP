We conducted additional experiments to measure the angle differences between gradients from different tasks by cosine similarity.

The cosine similarity is a measure of the angle between two vectors, which in this case represents the direction of the gradients. 
If the gradients for two task outputs have the same direction (i.e., they are pointing in the same direction), the cosine similarity 
will be close to 1, and the direction similarity will be close to 1. Conversely, if the gradients are pointing in opposite directions, 
the cosine similarity will be close to -1, and the direction similarity will be close to 0. By analyzing the direction similarity between 
the gradients for the different task outputs, we can gain insights into whether the gradients are aligned or in conflict with each other.

Our findings showed that the gradients were, more often than not, either aligned or only mildly conflicting, which supports the effectiveness 
of our approach in this particular context. Specifically, only the gradients 1 and 3 exhibited negative cosine 
similarity during the early stages of training. However, after 50 epochs, all similarities turned positive and remained constant. Notably, 
gradients 2 and 3 demonstrated the highest alignment, with a cosine similarity exceeding 0.8.
